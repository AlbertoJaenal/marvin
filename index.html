  Marvin thinks, therefore Marvin is.

  Never before has it been so easy to learn so deeply. Talk about feature 1, which is really very great. Feature 2 is also really great. But feature 3 is truly special: it helps you win friends and influence people. Marvin is architected for performance: both yours and your GPU's. And it all compiles before you can <s>get a cup of</s> say caffe.
