    Marvin (Minsky) is also the father of AI The term artifical intellgence (AI) was first coid by him and John McCarthy. He built SNARC in 1951, the first randomly wired neural network learning machine, during his PhD at Princeton (where I teach). Made out of 400 vacuum tubes, the machine was an early attempt at creating a learning system based on neural nets modeled on those the human brain uses. Minsky wrote the book Perceptrons (with Seymour Papert), which became the foundational work in the analysis of artificial neural networks. He is co-founder of MIT's AI lab, where I got my PhD.

    Anti-logic: He found that solving difficult problems in vision and NLP required ad-hoc solutions â€“ they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like logic) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior.
